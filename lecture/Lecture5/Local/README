This bundle contains the files needed for Lecture 9. 

The main file is DeclareSubstitution.hs. However, before we can 
use that file we should first create the parser for expressions.
This can be done as follows:

> happy DeclareParse.y

After this command is executed in the console, a DeclareParse.hs file 
should be available.

Now we can load DeclareSubstitution.hs on ghci:

> ghci DeclareSubstitution.hs
